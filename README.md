# SIMPLE E-COMMERCE API

## Mini-task for the backend developer position

### Instruction

Build an API for a simple e-commerce like website

### Features

Authentication:
Signup
Login
Email Confirmation OTP
Password Reset
View a Hompage with generated items for listing
Add some listed Items to a cart
Go to cart and checkout order

You don’t need to use any payment gateway, just simulate an endpoint to call that will simulate making a payment. E.g A post request to the endpoint xyz.com/pay will return a response message of ‘You have successfully made a payment’

I should be able to use an order ID to view the content of the order from an admin endpoint
